Class: unrthesis v1.0

This class is intended as a starting place for grad students who are beginning to 
typeset their thesis/dissertation. The class was primarily developed and tested with
the [master] flag set (rather than the [phd] flag). So if you are working on a Ph.D.
dissertation, be sure to double check that the style conforms to all UNR Grad School
style requirements.

For instructions on options and available commands look at the documentation in the
base/ directory and read the comments in the unrthesis.cls file.

This template was developed and tested only using ShareLatex and the pdfLaTeX compiler. 
No other configurations are supported, but most should work fine.
